# Newsletter Signup Form Component


## Overview

### The challenge

Stay updated with the latest tips and insights on product management by signing up for our newsletter! The Newsletter Signup Form Component is a footer section component of a website where users who want to see more content on how to improve as a product manager can sign up for the newsletter. Users can add their email and submit the form, see a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form, and receive form validation messages if the field is left empty or the email address is not formatted correctly. Additionally, users can view the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size and see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
